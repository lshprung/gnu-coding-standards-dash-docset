Here is a script and a Makefile for generating a GNU Coding Standards docset for Dash. The script is loosely based on benzado's script for GNU Make https://github.com/benzado/gnu-make-dash-docset.

- GNU Coding Standards: https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnustandards
- Dash: https://kapeli.com/dash

To generate a docset from the latest edition of the GNU Coding Standards, simply
execute `make` from the same directory as this README file. The latest edition
will be downloaded from www.gnu.org and packaged appropriately.

Requirements:

- any POSIX-compliant shell
- curl
- make
- sqlite3
